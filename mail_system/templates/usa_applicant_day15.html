<p>Hi, {{ first_name }}! Welcome to Day 15.</p>

<p><b>By this point, you should have already:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Ordered your TEFL certificate from ITTT.</li>
	<li>Checked your passport and applied for a passport renewal if necessary.</li>
	<li><b>Mailed your Police Clearance Packet to CVSC.</b></li>  
</ul>

<p>We assume you are already using a resume to apply for jobs. This resume is a bit different, since it's for government authorities to review and verify that you have 2 years of work experience.</p>

<p><b>Here's what you need to do today:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Review your resume and make sure you have listed at least 2 years of total work experience outside of college.</li>
	<li>Upload a PDF version of your resume <a href="{{ url_for('usa_applicant.get_resume') }}">here</a>.
</ul>

<p>Don't forget to check your <a href="{{ url_for('usa_applicant.dashboard') }}">dashboard</a> for job opportunities! No pressure, but we're expecting you to find a job in the next <b>10</b> days.</p>
<p>Read <a href="{{ url_for('usa_applicant.info_contract') }}">this</a> before you sign a contract.</p>

<p>Beep boop,<br/>
